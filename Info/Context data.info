The variable ctx_cop stores the current image on screen in abstract terms. It can be loaded on to the canvas with the function gen_canv().
ctx_cop is a list. currently, each item in the list is also a list and has 4 elements in it. The first one states what type of object it is. so if
if it is describing part of a pen stroke, the first item will be 'pen'.
The second item depends on the type of object it is;
    For pen strokes, it will be the your current mouse position and your previouse mouse position at the time of making the stroke(if you want to
learn why this is, look in 'How It Draws.txt').
    For rectangles, it will the anchored corner of the rectangle, as well as it's width and heigth(all these variables are stored in a local list
called mouse_poss).
    For lines, it will be the starting point of the line and ending point of the line(These are also stored in a local list called mouse_poss).
The third element is the line width of that object.
The forth and final element is the color of the object.
